# Welcome to GGS Documentation

You can find all the information you need to use GGS 3.2 in here. If this is your first time using GGS, consider starting with [Getting Started](2_getting_started.md).

View [Settings](3_settings.md) or [Components](4_components.md) if you have a question about a specific predefined setting or component.

Finally, visit [Troubleshoot](7_troubleshoot.md) if there's a general issue with the plugin (such as error messages). GGS 3.2 also has in-engine documentation. You can access it like any Godot documentation (`F1` by default).
