**Godot Game Settings (GGS)** is a small plugin for the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) that allows you to create and manage game settings. It comes with a set of prebuilt settings and user interface components that make it easy to make a settings menu. In addition, it allows developers to create settings or components with custom logic to suit their specific project.

If this is your first time using GGS, consider starting with [Getting Started](getting_started.md).

View [Settings](settings.md) and [Components](components.md) to see how to work with individual prebuilt things that come with GGS.
