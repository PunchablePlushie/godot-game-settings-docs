# Welcome to GGS Documentation

```admonish warning title="Older Version"
You're currently viewing documentation of GGS `3.0`, one of the older versions of the plugin. You can view the latest version from the navigation panel to the left.

You can find all the information you need to use GGS in here. If this is your first time using GGS, consider starting with [Getting Started](getting_started.md).

View [Settings](settings/settings.md) or [Components](components/components.md) if you have a question about a specific predefined setting or component.

Finally, visit [Troubleshoot](troubleshoot.md) if there's a general issue with the plugin (such as error messages).
